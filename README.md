## Week 1
- I've learned what DISMATH really is
- I've learned that DISMATH is diferent from the other math subjects
- I learned that when you don't study hard, you'll be screwed in the quizzes
- The intro lesson was the knights and knaves

## Week 2
- I learned how to use a truth table
- I also learned the symbols for and,not,or,xor,if then, and iff
- A lot of p and q

## Week 3
- I learned Quantifiers and Rules of Inference
- I also learned what words like tautology means
- I encountered complicated problems that can be solved faster with truth table but unfortunately, we can't do that in the quiz

## Week 4
- Proofs were introduced
- I learned different methods of proof such as direct, proof by contraposition,vacuous and trivial, and proof by contradiction
- The class learned learned what a rational number is.Very funny.
- I find the proofs quite confusing at first
