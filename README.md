# DISMATH portfolio of yvescasintahan11
dismathportfolio-yvescasintahan11 created by Classroom for GitHub

## Week 1
- I've learned what DISMATH really is
- I've learned that DISMATH is diferent from the other math subjects
- I learned that when you don't study hard, you'll be screwed in the quizzes
- The intro lesson was the knights and knaves
- I learned how to use a truth table
- I also learned the symbols for and,not,or,xor,if then, and iff
- A lot of p and q

## Week 2
- I learned Quantifiers and Rules of Inference
- I also learned what words like tautology means
- I encountered complicated problems that can be solved faster with truth table but unfortunately, we can't do that in the quiz

## Week 3
- Proofs were introduced
- I learned different methods of proof such as direct, proof by contraposition,vacuous and trivial, and proof by contradiction
- The class learned learned what a rational number is.It's quite funny when you think about it.
- I find the proofs quite confusing at first

## Week 4
- We had more examples on proofs by contradiction
- I learned how to prove different theorems
- I learned mathematical induction and it's steps which are: Basis and Inductive step
- I also learned Recursive definition
- I found induction confusing at first, but after a while, I found it a little less confusing

## Week 5
- I learned recursive algorithm
- I also learned program correctness, program verification, partial correctness
- I also encountered the hoare triple, which is quite confusing
- Sets was introduced

## Week 6
- I learned cardinality and its symbol which means alephnought
- Function was introduced

## Week 7
- No classes this week

## Week 8
- I learned algorithm
- I encountered linear and binary search

## Week 9
- I learned sorting algorithms
- I also learned BubbleSort Pseudocode and Insertion Sort Pseudocode
- Greedy Algorithm was introduced

## Week 10
- I learned Growth of Functions
- Big O, Big Omega, and complexity of algorithms were discussed

## Week 11
- No classes this week

## Week 12
- Graph Theory was introduced. I learned that graphs consist of vertices and edges.
- I also learned the many applications of graphs
- Handshaking theorem, Paths were discussed 
- I learned the Euler circuit, Euler path, Hamilton path, pendant, and matrices of graphs
- I also learned Isomorphism of graphs, Euler's Formula, and Kuratowski's Theorem

## Week 13
- Graph coloring was discussed
- I learned the four color theorem
- Trees was also discussed
- I learned the m-ary tree and a forest, which is 2 or more trees
- Modeling computation was also discussed
- I learned the structures in models of computation
- I also learned the Automata Theory and Finite state machines
