## Week 1
- I've learned what DISMATH really is
- I've learned that DISMATH is diferent from the other math subjects
- I learned that when you don't study hard, you'll be screwed in the quizzes
- The intro lesson was the knights and knaves
- I learned how to use a truth table
- I also learned the symbols for and,not,or,xor,if then, and iff
- A lot of p and q

## Week 2
- I learned Quantifiers and Rules of Inference
- I also learned what words like tautology means
- I encountered complicated problems that can be solved faster with truth table but unfortunately, we can't do that in the quiz

## Week 3
- Proofs were introduced
- I learned different methods of proof such as direct, proof by contraposition,vacuous and trivial, and proof by contradiction
- The class learned learned what a rational number is.It's quite funny when you think about it.
- I find the proofs quite confusing at first

## Week 4
- We had more examples on proofs by contradiction
- I learned how to prove different theorems
- I learned mathematical induction and it's steps which are: Basis and Inductive step
- I also learned Recursive definition
- I found induction confusing at first, but after a while, I found it a little less confusing

## Week 5
- I learned recursive algorithm
- I also learned program correctness, program verification, partial correctness
- I also encountered the hoare triple, which is quite confusing
- Sets was introduced

## Week 6
- I learned cardinality and its symbol which means alephnought
- Function was introduced
